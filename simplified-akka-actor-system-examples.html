<h2>Why another introduction to actors?</h2>
<p>I have been writing code professionally for over a decade and did not need to use the actor model of programming until recently.
Browsing the internet, I struggled a bit to grasp the concept.
</p><p>
Now, it could just be that un-learning and re-learning things are hard for me, and perhaps a new/different programmer may be picking these concepts up must faster than I can.
</p>
<p>Regardless, I decided to start a repository of actor examples that I could copy and contrive from other sources, simplifying and opinionating it my way.	
</p>

<h2>Introduction to Actors</h2>
<p>Actors are objects that understand and define behavior for certain messages.
	If you have learnt that "Everything is an Object" in the object oriented school of programming, you can now think as "Everything is an Actor".</p>
<p>Thus, a regulator on a fan is an actor. The message types the regulator understands are ON, OFF, SPEED-UP, SPEED-DOWN. The defined behaviors
	for those messages are that the fan will be switched on or off, or would speed up or slow down when corresponding messages are received.
</p>

<h2>When do you need Akka Actors?</h2>
<p>If you need to write concurrent, thread-safe programs, without thinking about how to actually provide thread-safety, you should consider using Akka actors.</p>
<p>I have tried to write concurrent code, but it requires a body of knowledge that is hard to master.
Understanding what to synchronize, what thread-safe object to use, what is volatile, etc. takes away the focus from writing
business logic to spending time carefully writing code that is bound to introduce functional bugs due to some race condition you missed to foresee.
</p>

<h2>How Akka Actors help solve concurrency?</h2>
<p>Actors can only affect each other's state by sending a message. There does not exist a mechanism for one actor to invoke a setter method, or access a public/protected variable,
or gain access to any shared variable via a new thread. By removing the possibility that an actor's internal state can be changed
by another actor through these mechanisms, a system achieves the highest level of encapsulation. This ensures there is zero-need for 
lock based synchronization, which is where most of the issues reside in concurrent programming.
</p>
<p>
When you define an actor, all you are doing is defining the message contract the actor can receive (in what Akka calls a mailbox), and the behavior
of the actor in response to those messages.	
</p>
<p>You can read more about the actor model here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Wikipedia - Actor Model</a></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
Here is the github repository where I will keep adding more examples as I contrive and/or find them.
<a href="https://github.com/psumiya/akka-examples">Simplified Akka Actor System Examples</a>
<h3>A Simple Actor</h3>
<p>This is a quickstart showing a single actor.	
	<ul>
		<li>The example will initialize an ActorSystem, this is the entry point into Akka.</li>
		<li>The actorSystem takes a name and a guardian actor, the guardian typically bootstraps the application.</li>
		<li>The example then sends a message asynchronously using the `!` (tell) method. This puts a message into the actor's mailbox, which is a message queue with some defined ordering.</li>
		<li>Multiple senders can send messages to an actor's mailbox, and the order of messages from the same sender is preserved.
			The communication between sender and receiver is asynchronous, meaning the sender does not wait for a response or acknowledgement and continues with other work.</li>
		<li>To create an actor, specify a behavior when it receives a message. The behavior of an actor is defined with a `receive` behavior factory.</li>
		<li>Message Types are typically declared as case classes.</li>
		<li>Actors are reactive and message driven. They are suspended silently in memory until a message is received in their mailbox.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Multiple Actors</h3>
<p>This is a quickstart showing multiple actors.
	<ul>
		<li>The example launches a root actor named GreeterBots, which further spawns two additional actors, a Bot actor and a Greeter actor.</li>
		<li>The behavior of the greeter is to greet, and to reply to a greeted message.</li>
		<li>The behavior of the bot actor is to simply keep sending messages to the Greeter a given number of times.</li>
		<li>The bot actor keeps track of the count as an internal state. This state is only updated in response to a newly received message.</li>
	</ul>
