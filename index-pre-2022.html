			<p>With Java 9 came an implementation of Reactive Streams right within the JDK. I wanted to take stock and begin a listing of the frameworks that are available today that leverage reactive principles and help build reactive microservices.</p>

			</p><p>	This is a war story of how I went from knowing nothing about Terraform and Kubernetes to successfully completing the migration off from Cloudformation and EC2 into Terraform with EKS.</p>

			<h2 class="ui header">My Experience with Scala: 6 months of Scala <div class="sub header">06/21/2020</div></h2>
			<p>I started a new job in November 2019, about 6 months ago. During onboarding, I was to work with a team that was using Scala as its primary language to process hundreds of thousands to multiple million messages per day.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had never used Scala, and had to make a decision, whether to give it a try, or whether to continue with the team I had interviewed that was not using Scala.
				I thought I will give it a month and decide what to do. Thus, began my tryst with Scala.

			<h2 class="ui header">This Blog's Architecture <div class="sub header">07/26/2019</div></h2>
			<p>I like reading and writing stories. The web is really simple to get a story across. This blog here is a Serverless website.
				I have written it in the age old way of html and css.</p>
			<p>
			All the contents are housed in and served from Amazon Web Services. At the time of writing, since past 2-3 years, my billing
			has rarely gone past 54 cents per month. So this is rather inexpensive. Continue to see why simple can sometimes also
			be cheap.</p>

			<h2 class="ui header">Serverless Architectures <div class="sub header">12/10/2016</div></h2>
			<p>Before we know what it is, it is easier to clarify what it is not. Contrary to its name, Serverless does not really mean
				there are no servers. The intent of serverless architectures is to transfer the operational burden of running and maintaining
				servers where your code runs to your chosen cloud provider.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is still a rapidly evolving space, but I reckon we will start to see the industry coalesce around this idea in the next
				decade (so, by the end of 2025). Essentially, my prediction is that by the end of 2025, containers (Kubernetes, Docker,
				et al) would have reached their decline stage in the product maturity chart and teams would be hard pressed to answer
				why serverless is not a cheaper and faster alternative to buidling distributed systems at scale.

			<p>The authors and designers of Java 8, with Stephen Colebourne (author:the Joda-Time library), under JSR 310, have finally
				delivered us the native Java Date Time API we always wanted, but never had. The core classes in the API
			are based on the ISO calendar system. They are thread-safe and immutable.</p>
